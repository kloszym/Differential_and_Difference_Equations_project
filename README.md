# Differential_and_Difference_Equations_project
The solution to Problem 4.4 Gravitational Potential from the subject Differential and Differential Equations can be found here.
A gnuplot-iostream.h header file is needed to fire the .cpp file, as the program draws on a live graph.
Also included is a picture of an example graph and derivation of the variational form.
